            <p>Each year, all U.S. Alliance churches are asked to submit their Local Alliance Church Annual Report. Pastors and editors, we need and greatly appreciate your help in accurately completing this important document. The information provided in it will be an important indicator of the way the Lord is moving throughout The Alliance.</p>
            <p>The Annual Report is important to your church and the Alliance family of churches, as it provides:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                  <p>Opportunity to celebrate the numbers of people who have made professions of faith and were baptized every year;</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <p>Vital statistical information that tells part of your church’s story over a 10-year period;</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <p>Records of your congregation’s partnership in Alliance missions;</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <p>Information about languages used in worship services, reflecting how our U.S. Alliance family is engaging its communities;</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <p>The “Going Deeper” resource, which is a useful, self-guided tool for interpreting your church’s Annual Report. It will be available after your church submits its report.</p>
